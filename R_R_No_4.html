				Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2: The Basics
						<ul>
							<p><li><b>I liked this reading because it laid out the foundation of JavaScript. There are six basic types of values:</b></li></p>
							<ol>

							<li><b>Numbers</b>: have 64 bits, allowing for any whole number less than 2^52</li>

							<li><b>Strings</b>: string together a bunch of text characters and are enclosed in quotes, two strings can be concatonated by using a + sign</li>

							<li><b>Booleans</b>: two types: true and false), operators: >,<,=. A piece of code that expresses a value is called an <b>expression</b>.</li>

							 <p>Larger than expressions are <b>statements</b>, which end with a semicolon. Statements should somehow "change the world," print something to the screen or change the statements that come after. <b>Programs</b> are made of statements that do things.<b>Variables</b> are used to essentially catch and hold values. We always name variables so that you can, for example, run the name in console and retrieve the value. This is starting to feel a lot like middle school algebra.</p>

							<li>Objects: are variables too, but can contain many values. They're containers for named values.</li>
							 <li>Functions: are pieces of program wrapped in a value, often producing a side effect (like an alert window). Every expression that produced a function value can be invoked by puting parathesis after it. Braces {} group statements into blocks.</li>

							 <p><b>Loops</b> affect the control flow of a program — they change the order in which statements are executed.
							 <li>Undefined values: are what you get when you ask for the value of an empty space. Functions which do not return an interesting value such as print and alert also return an undefined value.</li>
							
					</ul>
					<p>Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 3: Functions
						<ul>
							<p><li>Functions! They're "canned" code that can go through whenever you need the to, saving time.</li></p>
							<li>The variable name is what the resulting function is stored under.</li>
							<li><b>Pure functions:</b> are things in themselves. Non-pure functions might return different values based on all kinds of factors and have side effects.</li>
							<li>Which functions are visible inside a function is determined by the place of that function in the program text—functions defined inside another function retains access to the environment that existed in that function at the point when it was defined.</li>
							<li>Recursive functions call themselves. They sort of loop, but there is no "while" or "for" or even a local side effect to be seen, though the same effect is produced.</li>
							<li><b>Stacks</b> are where the context is stored, "one can visualize this as a stack of contexts. Every time a function is called, the current context is thrown on top of the stack. When a function returns, the context on top is taken off the stack and resumed."</li></p>
							<li>I thought this reading was overall useful to understanding functions, but had a lot of information that I didn't find applicable in terms of making functions.</li>

					<p>Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 11: Web Programming
						<ul><p><b>Server-side programming<b></p>
							<p><li>The internet has many different types of protocols, <b>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is one of them, and is used to retrieve web pages and the files associated with them. Computers make HTTP requests from servers for a page.</li>
							<li><b>Pages are identified by Universal Resource Locators (URLs)</b> and are composed of three parts (http://) identifies that the URL uses the HTTP protocol, followed by the server on which this page can be found, the end of the url, names a specific file on this server.</li>
							<li>
