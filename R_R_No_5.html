							<p><li><b>Clay Shirky's TED Talk: "Defend our freedom to share (or why SOPA is a bad idea)"</b><br> Shirky says in a TED talk that the 2012 SOPA and PIPA bills are the equivalent to a "mom and pop" bakery no longer being able to sell custom edible image cakes because of copyright infringement. Rising out of a media industry that's struggling to hold onto control of its content as technology allows for the easier coping of it, SOPA and PIPA are the latest two efforts from Congress (and their lobbying consituents) to clamp down on copyright infringement in a remix/share internet landscape. Shirky said that the proposed bills (which did not pass) would simply allow the government to block a domain name that a website had, for example, Google.comâ€”-but anybody could still access it through the numbered domain form, 172.41.201.22, etc. That's the technical, micro-picture, but in the larger scale, the acts would be reversing the legal ideology of "innocent until proven guilty," requiring users to deal with the burden of proof. </li>

							<li><b>Khan Academy: SOPA + PIPA explained</b><br>
							Salman Khan explains that SOPA (from the House of Representatives) and
							PIPA (from the Senate, slight differet, has the same intent) are not solutions to the problems they aim to address. 
							Although international sites might be infringing on Copyright law, they can be connected to US search engines, ad networks, DNS servers (which associate text with a number that points to another # server). The US can impose orders to cut ties. Problem: presumes guilt, shoot first at "enablers" which might be completely legal. Gets creepy: the spirit might be good...but the wording is pretty clear in going after anything that is associating, "enables or facilitates" could mean that anyone who comments on a site with a link to an illegal website, that could be interpreted as a enabling or facilitating. Entire sites could be taken down, not just the user-generated illegal content.</li>

							<li><b>28c3: The coming war on general computation</b>:<br> DRM.06 was the first step in making sure software wasn't duplicated. Basically they were defects. But they didn't work. People would release cracked versions. Anti-copying strategies only became more fraught. By 1996, people knew something was going to happen: an "information economy"; selling information, a boring way of what you could do with info and how to *charge* them for it. An unrealistic solution of sorts, 1996 WIPO treaty passed by the UN which created laws that made it illegal to extract secrets from unlocking programs, to host copyrighted content, along with a streamlined process to remove stuff from the internet without having to deal with laywers and judges. However, these were unrealistic and somehow, copying only got easier following the passage of these laws. We also shouldn't believe that our problems can't be solved as long as stupidity and evil are in the halls of power. Here's why information technology policy is so confounding: it may have effects on so many other things. Get rid of Piratebay.org is not = change the loud beeps on walk signals. Although it satisfies that we must do something just for the sake of doing something. MPAA and other sponsors of SOPA say that the bill would work because similar measures work in Uzbekistan and China. Doctorow questions what is the price we pay to preserve Top 40 music and Ashton Kutcher movies.</li><ul><li>This is relevant to the development of

							REST architectural style, the style HTTP is made in, the architeture of the web today.

							Roy Fielding a PhD student at UCI basically realized how inaccessible APIs were and created a way to use HTTP to interact with APIs. I can't imagine how this more efficient system has helped make it easier to get and copy data. 

							You can also write (post) data to the API. You could tweet through an API, but there's authentication (exchanging credentials for access tokens).</li></ul>


						


							 <li><b>Jon Oliver on Net Neutrality</b><br> basically, big companies could buy their way into a "hyperspeed" lane. Oliver is skeptical obviously, questioning how all internet will be slowed down in respect. Comcast has spent more than any other company (except a defense contractor); the guy who used to run the lobbying arm of cable companies - is now running the FCC. Also, 96% of the American population has access to only TWO companies. "Net Neutrality shouldn't be called Preventing Internet Fuckery"</li>
