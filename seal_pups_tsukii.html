			<h1>PUPPIES OF THE SEA: Seal pups</h1>

			<p>During the cold winter months, a few million harp seals feed in the rich waters of eastern Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. As spring approaches, about one-third of the seals gather on the ice around Canada's Magdalen Islands and Labrador to give birth.
			Within a week or so around March 1st of each year about 500,000 seal pups are born on the ice floes, providing one of the most spectacular wildlife events in North America.</p>

			<p>Although the ice floes provide a birthing place that is safe from predators, it is not safe from seal hunters. The seal hunt is one of the very few hunts that occurs in the spring when young are being born. A harp seal can be legally killed as soon as it has begun to moult its white hair - about 2 weeks after birth.</p>

			<p>Good news though! Recently tours have begun bringing thousands of wildlife lovers to the ice floes to hunt the seals with cameras rather than clubs.</p>
