				Highlights from and reflections on the readings</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Complete Beginner's Guide to Interaction Design</li>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Affordances</b> represent "action possibilities" between an actor and their environment and express the functionality of a service. For example, it helps if a button looks clickable.</li>
							<li><b>The best types of interaction designs don't exist</b>, they just move the user along seamlessly. I completely agree with this "less is less" mentality. I find MSNBC overwhelming, but Craigslist easy-to-use.</li>
						</ul>
<p>
					<li>Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"
						<ul>
							<li><b>Design dialog to yield closure,</b> basically, sequences of actions should be organized to have a beginning, middle and end. Feedback at the end gives the user a sense of accomplishment. This kind of reminded me of a feedback loop.</li>
							<li><b>Permit easy reversal of actions:</b> actions should be easy to undo, promoting the user as the internal locus of control.</li>
						</ul>
<p>
					<li>Why Angry Birds is so successful</li>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Response time</b> is "actually a resource that can be leveraged to add to the quality and depth of engagement or a user interface." Design is something that is not quite always visible, it really is, in its purest sense, controlling the viewer user, making them wait or look at a certain thing and capturing their gaze. In Angry Birds, "it gives the user time to structure an error correction strategy (more arc, more speed, better strategy)".
							</li>

						</ul>

	<p>					
					<li>Apple's OSX Human Interface Guidelines</li>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Mental Model</b> is the idea that models for doing tasks alread exist, and using these models helps people become familiar with their environment in the digital world. For example the mental model of "taking out the trash" is expressed by emptying the recyling bin and clearing files you've decided you really want to get rid of.</li>
						

							<li><b>Feedback & Communication:</b> When a user does something, subtle animation can often respond to reveal the consequences of the action. For example, when a window is minimized, it slides into the corner, showing where it can be found again. I think in web design, animation can also be used for this same purpose. The changing between a simple pause and play button on YouTube is a good example of this.</li>
						</ul>


						<p>
					<li>How users read on the web</li>
						<ul>
							<li>I thought this reading really addresed <b>how design can help guide the reader in a cluttered web landscape.</b> This reading focused on a report which found that users inherently are skeptical of what they read, thus subjective, promotional facts slow down readers because they immiediately questions them. Lists, smaller paragraphs and scannable layouts are the most impactful. In fact, the version that was a complete list with no numbers had a 124% improved readability than the condition, which was mainly a paragraph with numbers. The takeaway is: less is more.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
					<li>The next big thing in responsive design</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Designer coders from Code and Theory, Dan Gardner and Mike Treff, (who most recently redesigned the LATimes.com page) argue that designing for the particular screen/platform is only half the battleâ€”designers should look to old media, like print publications, to learn how to design for content and story.</li>
							<li>"To capture a user's attention for the next generation of the web, you'll need more than just responsive design. You'll need reponsive philosophy."</li>
							<li><b>Does a well-designed homepage even matter?</b>...when users are retrieving articles through Facebook? The authors criticize online media by simply throwing in a "comments" section at the end of their articles rather than "making them stick around...What they should be doing is reusing more dynamic designs and responding to users to create an ideal path for them to follow" which involves complex algorithms to calclate an article the reader of that article would like to possibly read next.</li>
							<li>Thus, design is part aesthetic and partly the machine Vannevar Bush dreamed of. It's inside the system and outside.</li>
