        <li><b>Letter of intent</b><br>
        The website will be used by anyone (probably someone the government
        deems an "unauthorized immigrant") seeking more information regarding
        how to be here legally, if they qualify for any governmental relief
        programs. The website is seeking to serve those who have limited or no
        access to information regarding their immigration status so that they
        don't get taken advantage of by bad lawyers.</li>

<p>
          </p>
        <li><b>Theme and Subject</b><br>
        I want to provide a simple, demystifying experience. The design and
        user experience will reflect this emphasis on clarity. The second layer
        of the website is to provide context. There is a forgotten knowledge of
        immigration history that reveals how policy today is an extension of
        discriminatory immigration policy was used to construct an "ideal"
        (white) America.<br></li>


        <li style="list-style: none">The first experience is one of
        practicality. For this reason it must also be mobile optimized.</li>

<p>
          </p>
        <li><b>Scope</b><br>
        I need to know how to code for smaller viewports and how to capture
        user input (Javascript).For citizens, I hope it will build empathy and
        change their views on immigration reform. Here are some standard
        arguments against my viewpoint that I will keep in mind: "why should I
        even care about immigrants? They are just taking our jobs. America is a
        melting pot. What are you talking about? America has been the land of
        immigrants: Give us your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning
        to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these,
        the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I left my lamp beside the golden
        door!"</li>


<p>
          </p>
        <li><b>Design</b><br>
      	Here's my rudimentary mock-up.</li>

        <li><b>Research</b><br>
        I've been compiling my research here:<br>
