				I found it interesting how Berners-Lee and his co-authors described the role of a W3 "client" as something that "displays an object" requested from the serverâ€”"and within a second the infomation, is presented." The language used in his description really reminded me of how we still discuss the function of Javascript. Also, I hardly ever think of the request function, that all of this HTML was essentially created just for the purpose of making it easier to request packets of information. And thanks to the development of user-interface today, requesting information has become effortless.

				<p>

				In describing what exactly the W3 stands for, Berners-Lee breaks down the components:
				<ul>
				<li>Universal Resource Identifiers (addresses for objects and what we now call URLs)</li>

				<li>Berners-Lee describes HTTP as a "simple request/response" protocol used that passes the string of the address for the server to be contacted and a substring to be passed to the server. The "/" represents a hierarchical space and the "?" is a separator between the address of an object and a query operation applied.</li>

				<li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): a language of communication that "flows" over the network. It is a way for elements to be structured.</li></ul>

				Here's what info.cern.ch, a website that provided information about the Web, looked like back then:<p>

				<p>Berners-Lee was forward-looking when establishing the groundwork for the web and considered scalability of the web: "The fact that it is easy to address an object anywhere on the Internet is essential for the system to scale, and for the information space to be independent of the network and server topology"
