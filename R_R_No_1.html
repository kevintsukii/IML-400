				"Putting work on the Internet is more like giving birth than creating a static object." -Joichi Ito (1997)</p>

			<p>
				Five years before Creative Commons released licenses, Ito seemed to understand that at the heart of the internet, is the deconstruction of the system of ownership. Whatever is put out there can be taken and remixed. I am fascinated by the idea that the internet is a "working anarchy" and is only able to survive as such. The more spread out and "inefficient" the less prone it is to imploding. Ito repeats over and over again that context is the medium of the internet. He uses the word "meme" to describe a product of this context that is easy to reproduce and familiar. And his words couldn't ring more true 17 years later, that our memes are a product of the interet's community of sharing and remixing.

				More than 50 years ago, Vannevar Bush discusses a "memex," a contraption that can store books and photos that can be pulled up and referenced when needed. He describes operations that sound like a primal Google, "If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions" (45). Bush speaks of a shift in using science for extending the powers of man's mind, as opposed to his physical powers (because they pretty much destroyed the world in World War II). Indeed the developed form of the memex, the computer and its interwebs have allowed for the expansion of man's knowledge, but we are now seeing how organizations like the Islamic State have taken advanatage of the internet to recruit followers and spread its extremist ideology "throwing masses of people against one another with cruel weapons" (38). Padaroxically, war and its ideology, the very reason why Vannevar decided we should invest in the expansion of man's knowledge, cannot be censored in the anarchy that is the internet.
