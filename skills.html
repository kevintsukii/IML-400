			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>I think the first time I coded was in the 6th grade, messing with the HTML and CSS of my MySpace template in order to change the color and fonts of my profile page. Although my knowledge of code has grown, I still mostly have learned coding through tinkering with existing code in order to get the look that I want. And this is where I confess that I'm interested in code because I want to be able to execute the designs that I come up with. I rarely build from the ground up. Something I'd like to gain from this class is the ability and practice to make websites quickly, and to be able to look at other websites and be literate in their work and how they built their products.

			Last semester in a journalism class we had to use two templates to present articles we had made. My final project was <a href="http://alongtheline.ascjweb.com/food/ktsukii/">this webpage</a> which I made, heavily reworking the <a href="http://alongtheline.ascjweb.com/home/">template</a>. I have a pretty strong grasp on HTML, but still need to learn more about divs and wrappers. For CSS, I usually just get confused between what . and # are supposed to be used for. I'm pretty new to JavaScript but am starting to get it. I would like to also dip my feed into SQL, Ruby, Python and PHP.
